## Introduction

This project is the simplest and most foundational program in our repository's CS2 cheat series. It operates as a console-based (black window) version with no graphical rendering and uses external read/write methods without injection, serving as the groundwork for more advanced implementations.

## Features and Keybinds

The following lists the features and their corresponding keybinds for activating or toggling functionalities:

- **F1**: Toggle Blue X-Ray Wallhack  
  Renders walls semi-transparent to reveal players and objects behind them.  
- **F2**: Toggle Entity Glow Wallhack  
  Applies a glowing outline to entities for enhanced visibility through walls.  
- **F3**: Toggle Memory-Based Aimbot  
  Automatically locks the crosshair onto enemies using memory manipulation.  
- **F4**: Toggle Mouse-Movement Aimbot  
  Simulates natural mouse movements to aim at enemies smoothly.  
- **F5**: Toggle Silent Aimbot  
  Aims at enemies without visibly moving the crosshair on the screen.  
- **F6**: Set Aimbot Target to Enemies Only  
  Restricts aimbot targeting to enemy players.  
- **F7**: Set Aimbot Target to All Entities  
  Expands aimbot targeting to include all entities (enemies, teammates, etc.).  
- **F8**: Toggle Visibility-Based Aimbot Targeting  
  Targets entities only if they are visible (not obstructed by walls or objects).  
- **F9**: Toggle Distance-Based Aimbot Targeting  
  Prioritizes entities based on their proximity to the crosshair.
